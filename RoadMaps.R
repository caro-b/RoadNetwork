# only use osm roads, add additional IZW roads
roads_union <- rbind(roads_osm_clip, roads_2014_new)



## buffer around roads (as OSM only provides lines, not the original street width)
# highway width = 22m
# crs needs to be in long/lat for buffer in meters
roads_union@proj4string # WGS84 (EPSG: 4326)

# set crs to EPSG:3405 VN-2000 / UTM zone 48N
# https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/vn-2000-utm-zone-48n/
# Proj4js.defs["EPSG:3405"] = "+proj=utm +zone=48 +ellps=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs";
#roads_union <- spTransform(roads_union, CRS("+proj=utm +zone=48 +ellps=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"))

roads_union_buffer <- buffer(roads_union, width = 0.0005, dissolve=F) #~50m buffer

plot(roads_union)
plot(roads_union_buffer, add=T)

#### question for Martin: why does area(gfc_01_roads_pol) correspond to pixel size (900mÂ²), but width in buffer() only works with degrees?? ####
## buffer() - Unit of width is meter if x has a longitude/latitude CRS
